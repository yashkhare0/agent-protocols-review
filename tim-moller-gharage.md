## GHARAGE

### Overview
- **Founded:** 2019
- **HQ:** Hamburg, Germany (+ Singapore office)
- **Type:** Venture studio + venture fund (hybrid model)
- **Focus:** Travel and retail startups at the intersection of travel, trade, and technology
- **Tagline:** "Re-imagining how we travel"
- **Websites:** gharage.io (vision hub), gharage.ventures (fund)
- **PitchBook:** pitchbook.com/profiles/investor/521057-08

### The Backer: Gebr. Heinemann
GHARAGE is supported by **Gebr. Heinemann SE & Co. KG** — this is almost certainly the "$70B GMV retailer" Tim mentioned.

**Gebr. Heinemann facts:**
- **Founded:** 1879 in Hamburg, Germany
- **Revenue:** €4.3 billion (2024)
- **Employees:** 10,351 (2024)
- **Industry:** International travel retail (duty-free shops, airport retail)
- **Global footprint:** Operates across Europe and Asia
- **Family-owned:** 4th/5th generation Heinemann family
- **Key locations:** Major airports worldwide — Frankfurt, Singapore, and hundreds more
- **Subsidiaries:** Heinemann Asia Pacific (Singapore HQ), Heinemann Americas, and more
- **What they do:** Wholesale distribution + self-operated retail of duty-free goods (perfume, cosmetics, tobacco, liquor, fashion, confectionery) in airports, ferries, border shops

> **Note on the "$70B GMV" claim:** Gebr. Heinemann's own revenue is €4.3B, but as a distributor AND retailer across hundreds of airports, the total GMV flowing through their network (including partner-operated shops they supply) could reasonably reach $70B. They supply goods to countless duty-free operators globally. Tim may be referring to the total retail ecosystem they touch, not just their direct revenue.

### GHARAGE's Position
GHARAGE is Gebr. Heinemann's **innovation and investment arm** — set up to find and fund startups that will shape the future of travel and retail. This is a corporate VC with a very specific strategic mandate.

**What this means for Yash:**
- GHARAGE isn't just writing checks — they have direct access to Gebr. Heinemann's global retail infrastructure
- If they invest, they can potentially deploy your product across hundreds of airport/travel retail locations
- They're looking for strategic alignment, not just financial returns

### GHARAGE Portfolio (confirmed investments)
| Company | Year | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Bounce | 2025 | Luggage storage network |
| Cube Asia | 2024 | Asia-focused |
| Faro | 2024 | |
| File.AI | 2024 | AI document processing |
| Neoke | 2023 | |
| Returnkey | 2023 | Returns management |
| Zolo | 2023 | |

**Notable:** File.AI (2024) shows they're already investing in AI companies. The move into "agentic commerce" is a natural evolution.

### GHARAGE Team Structure
- Collective of "strategists, designers, innovators, and investors"
- Mission: "bringing the magic of travel back to the journeys themselves"
- They describe themselves as challenging the industry "from the outside-in"
- Collaborate with "forward-thinking companies and institutions across the travel ecosystem"

## Strategic Analysis for the Call

### Why Tim reached out to Yash specifically:
1. **Agentic commerce is the next frontier for travel retail** — airports are high-traffic, high-friction environments perfect for AI agents (recommendations, concierge, multilingual customer service, personalized offers)
2. **"Shopify for agentic applications"** maps perfectly to Heinemann's need — they operate hundreds of retail locations that could each deploy agents
3. **Tim said "next-age distribution channels"** — he's thinking about how products reach consumers through AI-mediated experiences, not just traditional shelves

### What GHARAGE/Heinemann likely needs:
- **Multilingual AI concierge** for duty-free shops (travelers speak every language)
- **Personalized product recommendations** based on traveler profile (destination, nationality, preferences)
- **Agentic shopping** — "I'm flying to Tokyo, what should I buy duty-free?" answered by an AI that knows inventory, prices, and personal preferences
- **Agent deployment platform** — if they want agents across 500+ locations, they need a platform to manage them (CAPP!)
- **Commerce integration** — agents that can actually complete transactions, not just recommend

### Questions to ask Tim:
1. "How is Heinemann currently thinking about AI in the travel retail experience?"
2. "Are you seeing any of your portfolio companies exploring agentic interfaces?"
3. "What would the deployment model look like — would Heinemann want a centralized platform or per-location agents?"
4. "What's the biggest friction point in the travel retail customer journey today?"
5. "How do you see the role of ChatGPT / voice agents in physical retail spaces?"

### What NOT to say:
- Don't oversell — you're early, own it
- Don't name-drop CAPP as a finished product — position it as "the platform we're building"
- Don't promise timelines you can't keep
- Don't share pricing — it's exploratory

### Positioning:
> "We're building the infrastructure layer for deploying agentic applications in commerce. Think Shopify, but instead of storefronts, you're deploying AI agents that can sell, recommend, and service customers across any AI surface — ChatGPT, WhatsApp, in-store kiosks. We're taking an agency-first approach: building and operating agents for businesses to deeply understand the problem before productizing."
